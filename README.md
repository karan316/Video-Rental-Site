This project is demonstrates different React features like building UI using components, using hooks to manage the state, use of stateless functional components and many more. 
It uses Node JS with Express as the backend service with Mongo DB used as the database. 
The site also has authentication using JWT for registering or logging in. Admin users have different set of privileges as compared to normal users (for eg. admin users can delete a movie where as normal users cannot).
I will soon update the remote url for viewing the site live!
